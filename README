This is a basic implementation of my World of Warcraft guild's take on the shroud loot system.  The basics of SLS are as follows:
1. Every item has a low fixed cost (LFC)
2. Each raid member should receive the LFC for attending the raid
3. A raid member can bid either the LFC or half of their current points for a item
4. The highest bidder wins the item and has the bid subtracted from their total.  In the event of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly.

Our guild has made a couple of extensions to the loot system:
1. If you arrive on time, you get a small bonus
2. If you leave early, you get penalized
